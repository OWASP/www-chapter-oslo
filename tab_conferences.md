FINN.no's Secret Sauce: how we went from finding 15 vulnerabilities to over 100 per year!

Emil Vaagland - IT Security Manager @ FINN.no

Since 2019 FINN.no has tried a lot of different appsec tools and processes to improve our security. In this talk you will learn about the most effective of them all, namely our private bug bounty program. In terms of finding real vulnerabilities, this activity outshines any other appsec tool or process by a large margin, it enables us to find a lot more vulnerabilities than before at a fraction of the cost of traditional pen-testing. We will talk about  how to run an effective bug bounty program and why it should be the key ingredient of your appsec program. We will also show-case some high impact vulnerability reports we have received to show the real impact you can get from a bug bounty program.

The security metric to rule them all: MTTR!

Ståle Pettersen - Head of Product & Application Security

You now scan everything! Great job! Now you have a huge pile of vulnerabilities scattered around in different scanners.... what to do next? We'll see how we have put all vulnerabilities into one open source platform, created a single overview across all of your security solutions and why we believe our Mean Time To Remediation (MTTR) metrics is considered the best security metric of them all, and how you can also start to track your MTTR.

Secure code at DevOps speed: How security can drive non-functional requirements

Nora Tomas - Vipps MobilePay

Is security slowing down your development process for you as a developer? This talk aims to change that perception. We will present real case studies showcasing how systems with high security requirements can still be responsive, user friendly, and easy for developers to work with. 

Learn about the security code patterns that enable development efficiency, user friendliness, and response speed, with examples from the Vipps MobilePay login system that handles over 1.2 billion user logins per year.  

We'll explore:
1. How JWT tokens can aid developers with more than just authentication. 
2. How Zero Knowledge Proof can be utilised to achieve both increased security and user friendliness.
3. An async-first strategy for implementing security features (such as blocking of users) while still keeping a system quick and responsive.

Secure system integrations

Tobias Ahnoff - Application security specialist at Omegapoint

Integrations between backend services, without human interaction, is a requirement for most businesses.

Over the years this has been done in many ways, to fit both business requirements and relevant threat models. Some solutions are less secure than others and often integrations introduce risk and attack vectors. 

Based on experiences from both building integrations and performing penetration tests and security reviews, this presentation will look at some common solutions. Focus will be on authentication for integrations using HTTP, from custom API-keys and Basic Authentication to mutual TLS and OAuth 2.0 DPoP. 

Tuesday 1:15 PM · 30 min · 3 - Scandic Victoria, Kongressal 1

Visualizing Access Control: Simplifying Testing for helsenorge.no

Davrondzhon Gafurov - Software Security

Access control is the heart of security of the software. Paradoxically, issues related to access control top the list in the OWASP Top 10. Effectively preventing and mitigating such issues requires rigorous testing approach of access control. 

However, comprehending the access control mechanism of complex system like helsenorge.no, with millions of users and lines of code, is inherently challenging. Traditional methods involve reading extensive textual requirements or delving into low-level code details and database tables. To overcome these challenges by adhering to the principle of “a picture speaks a thousand words”, we developed a holistic and graphical representation of the helsenorge.no’s intricate access control mechanism, so called Access Control Tree (ACT). The ACT facilitated the systematic extraction of test cases with minimal cognitive load. Beyond its role in security testing, ACT serves as a valuable tool for learning, especially for newcomers, and promotes collaboration by fostering a common understanding among various roles in the team. 

In my talk I will present how we created Access Control Tree of helsenorge.no for security testing and hopefully it can inspire you as well.

Tuesday 2:00 PM · 30 min · 3 - Scandic Victoria, Kongressal 1

Http Header Injections: a Splitting Headache

Sofia Lindqvist - Security Specialist

In this talk I will explore so-called HTTP request splitting vulnerabilities, and how they can be used to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). I will present the results of looking for such vulnerabilities in open source code bases, and show examples of exploiting them in the wild.

Tuesday 3:00 PM · 30 min · 3 - Scandic Victoria, Kongressal 1

How to not do security

Emil Lunde - Utvikler i Bekk

This is the story about the time I looked at the security in one of the apps on my phone and got access to a cloud environment with data for millions of users.

In this presentation I will share a real-world example of poor security and my efforts to responsibly disclose the issues.

Tuesday 3:45 PM · 30 min · 3 - Scandic Victoria, Kongressal 1

Modding Multiplayer Into a 20 Year Old Single-Player Game

Vetle Hjelle - Pentester and Security Researcher at Kovert

Through years of reverse engineering and development, we've modded a 20 year old PlayStation game with online multiplayer functionality. This mod has been made to work with legacy hardware as well as running on emulator on PC. It runs a custom network protocol on a Lua scriptable game server. 

In this talk we'll look at how we've reverse engineered the game to find the necessary functions and data to add our custom behavior. We'll also briefly go into the server and protocol design considerations, as well the jailbreaks that enable the mod to work on console hardware.

Secure code from start – a journey through security training for developers

Nora Bodin - Teknisk sikkerhetskonsulent

Research shows that developers experience a responsibility for the security in the code they are writing. We also introduce more and more security tools in our development processes.
However, we still develop software with known vulnerabilities over and over again, so what is the problem?
In this presentation, I will introduce some structural problems related to security training of developers and the way automatic tools often are used.
The last two years I have worked in Skatteetaten with a structured security training program for developers. The security training is part of a bigger project in Skatteetaten to strengthen
the organisation’s operational security. One of the focus areas in the project is security reporting. We’ve seen first-hand how this contributes to the security training by making training and competency measurable.
In this presentation, I’ll share some tips and tricks based on our experience over the last two years.

How to gamify your mobile application security using OWASP Cornucopia

Johan Sydseter - Admincontrol AS, Application Security Engineer

OWASP Cornucopia is a mechanism in the form of a card game to assist software development teams identify security requirements in Agile, conventional, and formal development processes. It is language, platform, and technology agnostic. Admincontrol is using OWASP cornucopia to scale their security efforts and empower their teams to do application security work using gamification as a motivational factor.

Cornucopia had its 10th anniversary last year, it’s about time we released a new version of Cornucopia with a new Website App Edition updated with the ASVS 4.0 mapping and a Mobile App Edition with the MASVS 2.0 mapping for mobile development. At the same time we are also releasing the online version “Copi” for online and distributed collaboration.

Together with other Cornucopia enthusiasts, we are doing this to ensure the successful implementation of security practices for web- and mobile applications. We believe the best way to scale application security efforts and empower development teams to take ownership for application security and improve application security posture is to gamify the security requirement- and threat modelling processes. Let the development team come up with the requirements themselves and support them in the planning, design and implementation of application security. Cornucopia will help development teams come up with those requirements and support them in planning, designing and implementing application security best practices, and if they don’t find the game interesting, why don’t let them create their own threat modelling game using OWASP Cornucopia.

In this presentation we will talk about how Admincontrol uses Cornucopia to improve their product security using the upcoming mobile version of Cornucopia and what we have learned and gained from using Cornucopia in our development processes.

White Box Application Security Testing

Torjus Bryne Retterstøl - Security Specialist - Binary Security

Web application security testing has traditionally been performed black (or gray) box, without access to source code. This type of testing is susceptible to randomness, and the vulnerabilities that are identified are often dependent on the security tester’s word lists or fuzzing techniques. I will present how to perform white box security testing with access to source code and infrastructure to ensure better coverage of security testing and better bugs. The talk will showcase techniques and tools used with white box testing, and will demonstrate how these techniques were used to identify vulnerabilities in very popular software.

DevSecOps and ASPM: How to get there with insufficient funds and resources

Kim Engebretsen - Ops guy turned pentester turned security architect turned IAM implementer turned CISO turned manager turned developer turned engineer turned entrepreneur

The buzzwords DevSecOps and ASPM (Application Security Posture Management) have increased in popularity lately. What do they actually mean, what value do they bring, where do they fit in, and why will you eventually have to care about it? When we know the What and the Why, we are left with the How. How many tools and products do you need? And how much will it cost to both train your teams and buy all those licenses? 
Constrained with not enough funds or resources, how much of this growing technology stack can utilize FOSS (free open source software) alternatives, and at the same time how should we shape our teams core competency to stop recreating the wheel in every company?

**Track keynote: OWASP Juice Shop - Björn Kimminich, OWASP Juice Shop Project Leader**

Tuesday 9:00 AM · 30 min · 11 - Lillehammer Kino, sal 2

Once upon a time, developers and security experts relied on mostly server-side rendered vulnerable applications to train their web hacking skills. In 2014 the Juice Shop entered the stage as one of the first Rich Internet Application representatives. What started as a personal pet project with two dozen hacking challenges, became an OWASP Flagship project shortly after and grew in size, scope and use case coverage significantly over the years. Join Björn Kimminich on a tour through the origins, history and evolution of OWASP Juice Shop from 2014 to 2023, closing with a peek into the future of this juicy hacking delicacy.

**An interactive approach to secure coding training & awareness - Bjørnar Fidje Liberg, Security Engineer @ DNB**

Tuesday 9:45 AM · 30 min · 11 - Lillehammer Kino, sal 2

Developers are facing a steadily increasing pressure to deliver new functionality in a faster tempo, to stay competitive. This tempo means that the security responsibility, and therefore the need for security competence, has shifted more towards the developers. Paradoxically, higher pressure makes it more difficult to take the time for necessary training.

What can the security organization do to ease this issue? How can we motivate developers to spend more time on skills training? How should you balance between mandatory and optional training? And how can you keep the training material relevant to ~1000 developers working with totally different frameworks, languages, and infrastructure?

Hear more about how we have been working with these issues in DNB, and how to start a training & awareness program for secure coding.


**Prompt Injection: When Hackers Befriend Your AI - Vetle Hjelle, Pentester i Kovert**

Tuesday 10:45 AM · 30 min · 11 - Lillehammer Kino, sal 2

This is a technical presentation where we'll look at attacks on implementations of Large Language Models used for chatbots, sentiment analysis, and similar applications. In the lecture, we will look at how so-called "prompt injection" attacks occur, why they work, and then find good solutions on how to mitigate attacks and damage potential. AI is not brand new, but we know that its use will increase drastically in the next few years, and therefore it is important to take security seriously by considering security before using AI for sensitive operations.

In language models, the initial prompt (or "prompt") to direct the AI is a critical part of how your use of AI is unique and therefore also a business-critical secret. Prompt injection attacks can, among other things, be used to reveal the prompt. If you use AI to make automated decisions, it is even more critical if an attacker can turn your AI into their own ally.

**Secure authentication with FIDO, biometrics and security keys - Tjerand Silde, Security and Cryptography Expert and Trond Peder Hagen, CTO at PONE Biometrics**

Tuesday 11:30 AM · 30 min · 11 - Lillehammer Kino, sal 2

​​This talk is about how to replace passwords with biometrics and/or physical security keys using the FIDO protocol, an open standard that is available on all the most used devices, operating systems and browsers.

Passwords today pose the greatest risk to digital systems. They can be guessed, hacked or phished, and outdated password routines often mean that passwords have low entropy, are reused, or are stored insecurely. We have to do something about this. Now.

Biometrics is both a more user-friendly and secure way of authenticating users; biometric data provides a strong link between the person and digital identity, you don't have to remember many passwords, and biometric sensors are difficult to deceive.

Physical security keys can generate cryptographic keys that can be used instead of passwords, and you thus get much more entropy that makes them impossible to guess. These keys can be carried in your pocket, and be used to log in via USB, BLE or NFC.

The Fast ID Online (FIDO) protocol is an open standard that is now available on all the major platforms and enables password-free login to all digital services you want to use at work or in your free time. This talk will explain how all this is connected and how it can be put to use.

**Improving product and cloud security across over 100 teams - Ståle Pettersen, Schibsted, Head of Product & Application Security**

Tuesday 1:15 PM · 30 min · 11 - Lillehammer Kino, sal 2

Experience based presentation how we improved product security in Schibsted's 60+ companies and 150+ teams over the last 3 years. We have over 1000 developers and therefore do a lot of development. What kind of approach did we have to the challenge, and what specific processes, training, tools, and solutions did we introduce across Schibsted? We'll talk concrete tools (commercial and non-commercial), share our threat model template, our tiered risk based approach we took and more.

Don't miss out on this unparalleled opportunity to discover how Schibsted conquered the realm of product security. Join us for an unforgettable presentation that will leave you inspired, informed, and empowered.


**Start with why: Are we doing stuff just because? - Jenny Marie Ellingsæter, Director and Henrik Jenssen, Manager**

Tuesday 2:00 PM · 30 min · 11 - Lillehammer Kino, sal 2

Many businesses in Norway have made great strides in establishing agile software development. Autonomous and multidisciplinary teams are largely the norm and CI/CD has almost become standard practice, all made possible by new technologies and tools.

DevOps and agile principles allow for efficient software development, and it can be argued that they have contributed to several successful IT projects. At the same time, these trends in software development have brought about challenges regarding information security and privacy.

We highlight the importance of being aware of one's own organizational context and objectives, and to question whether we are doing stuff just because they work for others, rather than to select the development practices which are right for our organization.

ABOUT THE PRESENTATION
With our digital systems growing increasingly distributed and our tech stacks increasingly heterogeneous, we need to devise new models around both identity and access control. In this presentation we’ll explore a distributed, scalable model for API security, identity and authorization policy enforcement in a microservice environment. After a brief introduction to the technologies involved, we’ll take a deep dive into an architecture utilizing OAuth2 and OpenID Connect for carrying identity across our distributed systems, and how once identity is established, we may leverage Open Policy Agent (OPA) for fine-grained policy based access control in our APIs. We’ll learn how to use Rego, the policy language used by OPA, to write concise and clear policies for access control, as well as methods for distributing them across our platforms and how to monitor policy enforcement in real-time.

WHEN?
Tuesday, 13:15 - 13:45

Language
English

ABOUT THE PRESENTATION
Attackers like to use the easiest way into organizations that's in line with their goals. Most recently, the software supply chain has been that path. Implanting a back door during build time or directly in the source code allows for far-reaching breaches. This can be via commercial vendors, like with SolarWinds hack or the spread of NotPetya through MeDoc in the Ukraine. It the same way, malicious implants can be introduced through open source packages that are not curated sufficiently. Companies like PayPal and Microsoft have fallen victim to this.
In this presentation, we give a 360 degree overview about potential risks to the software supply chain using real-world breaches. Of course, we want to discuss options for how to secure your organization and supply chain.

ABOUT THE PRESENTER

**Serverless Security: New risks require new approach - Paolo Spagli, Sr. Security Researcher, Cloud-Native**

TRACK 11 – OWASP
Applicationsecurity

WHERE?
Lillehammer Kino sal 2

WHEN?
Tuesday, 14:00 - 14:30

Language
English

ABOUT THE PRESENTATION
Serverless technology eliminates the need for development teams to provision servers, and it also results in some security threats being passed to the cloud provider. This frees up the developers to concentrate on building logic and producing value quickly. But cloud functions still execute code. If the software is written poorly, it can lead to a cloud disaster.

What are the new challenges that organization now faces? In many organizations, the application security team struggles to keep up with the speed of development in a serverless environment. Traditional testing tools not only provide very limited coverage, but also slow development cycles unacceptably. Serverless code contains a mixture of cloud configurations and application programming interfaces. As a result, legacy solutions lack the context that is necessary in a serverless environment, and the consequence is a lack of observability and slower response times.
Fortunately, it does not have to be this way. Organizations can leverage robust security during serverless development, automatically—if it is done properly.

ABOUT THE PRESENTER
Paolo Spagli is Senior Security Researcher for Cloud-Native technologies at Contrast Security. In this role he is committed to help development teams shipping secure applications in the cloud.

**Ingenting er nytt i OAuth 2.1-spesifikasjonen. Hvorfor trenger vi den da? - Jon Even Rosengren, Sikkerhetskonsulent, Accenture**

Spor 11 – OWASP
Applikasjonssikkerhet

Hvor?
Lillehammer Kino sal 2

Når?
Tirsdag, 16:00 - 16:30

Om foredraget
OAuth er en veldig populær åpen standard som lar deg delegere tilganger til tredjepartsapplikasjoner uten å måtte dele påloggingsdetaljene dine. Den opprinnelige OAuth 2.0-spesifikasjonen (RFC 6749) ble publisert i oktober 2012 og det har vært en rekke utvidelser de siste årene som enten har lagt til eller fjernet funksjonalitet fra kjernespesifikasjonen.
OAuth 2.1 forsøker å konsolidere og forenkle alt som har skjedd siden 2012 inn i en ny spesifikasjon basert på beste praksis, teknologiske endringer og oppdaterte trusselbilder.
Foredraget vil ta for seg behovet for en ny konsolidert versjon av kjernespesifikasjonen, hvilke endringer som er innført og begrunnelsen for disse endringene. Det blir gitt en kort introduksjon til OAuth, men det anbefales å ha noe forhåndskjennskap til standarden ettersom vi vil dykke ned i en del tekniske detaljer utover i foredraget.

Presentations

What We’ve Learned From Billions of Security Reports - Scott Helme, Security Researcher

Running one of the largest security reporting platforms of its kind, we handle billions of security reports for our customers every single month. Come and learn how we've scaled from handling 10,000 reports per month to 10,000 reports per second and the many evolutions our infrastructure has gone through. Alongside that come and see how, with our bird’s-eye view of such a diverse ecosystem, we’ve helped identify malware in a multinational organisation, had a malicious browser plugin taken down and much more!

Building an agile Security Organization - Monica Verma, PwC Digital Trust

In 2017, Vipps was carved out from DNB. It is now owned by multiple banks, and Vipps has had to re-engineer its approach to Security Governance. PwC had been contracted by Vipps in Winter 2017 to build an agile Information Security Management System (ISMS). Additionally, PwC was engaged to help with the implementation of metrics & security monitoring within the organization, handling security incident operations and assisting Vipps with ISMS and Security Governance following the merger. In this talk, we'll go through the business case of how we built agile ISMS, how PwC intends to support Vipps' ISMS and Security Architecture, and how this could transform the way Vipps is seen and experienced by its customers.


The State of Your Supply Chain - Andrew Martin, Control Plane

Container security often focuses on runtime best-practices whilst neglecting delivery of the software in the supply chain. Application, library, and OS vulnerabilities are a likely route to data exfiltration, and emerging technologies in the container ecosystem offer a new opportunity to mitigate this risk. Treating containers as immutable artefacts and injecting configuration allows us to "upgrade" images by rebuilding and shipping whole software bundles, avoiding configuration drift and state inconsistencies. This makes it possible to constantly patch software, and to easily enforce governance of artefacts both pre- and post-deployment. In this talk we detail an ideal, security-hardened container supply chain, describe the current state of the ecosystem, and dig into specific tools. Grafeas, Kritis, in-toto, Clair, Micro Scanner, TUF, and Notary are covered, and we demo how to gate container image pipelines and deployments on cryptographically verified supply chain metadata.


When exploits are blind - Chris Dale, Netsecurity

Demonstration based presentation. Only intro and outro powerpoint slides. Demonstrate user enumeration using timing attacks. Especially prominent when companies have implemented bcrypt/scrypt/pbkdf#2. Attack vector which is very useful in many cases today, notably against Lync/Skype4B installations today. Further password spray into a solution. Discover, analyze and fully exploit reverse-shell command injection. How to find these across large systems? How dose vulnerability scanners work, and how do they detect this? Introduction to Burp Collaborator. Introduction to script for merging attack data into hundreds of Burp Collaborators. Discover, analyze and fully exploit blind SQL Injection. Demonstrating Burp Intruder cluster bomb attack to enumerate out table data.


Modern Web Application Vulnerabilities - Erlend Oftedal, Blank AS

With the emerging popularity of bug bounty programs, lesser known and even brand new vulnerability classes are gaining popularity. This talk will give a walk-though of some of these vulnerabilities, how they occur in modern web applications and how they can be found and fixed.


Machine Learning for Security - Alan Saied, Visma

The ability to mathematically classify patterns, predict events and/or identify abnormalities within a wide range of data is known as Machine Learning. For the purpose of this conference , we explain the power of data and how it can be used with Machine Learning models to identify abnormal behaviour within complex environments. We also explain the ingredients and the steps required to build a Machine Learning models to serve security tasks. This will further be followed by its complications in terms of false positives, accuracy of detection and validity of model and how this can be improved.
